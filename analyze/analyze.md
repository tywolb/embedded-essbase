# Analyze and Investigate PeakGear Sales

## Introduction

In this optional lab, you will connect Oracle Smart View to the PeakGear cube, compare sales by period, product, and store, and drill through from a cube summary to the supporting Lakehouse transaction records.

Estimated Time: 25 minutes

### About Smart View and Drill-Through

Smart View lets you analyze Essbase data in Microsoft Excel. A drill-through report can show the detailed source records behind a cube value when an Essbase datasource and drillable region have been configured for the cube.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Connect Smart View to the PeakGear cube.
- Compare PeakGear sales across periods, products, and stores.
- Drill through from a sales value to the underlying Lakehouse detail.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- Microsoft Excel with a compatible Oracle Smart View for Office installation.
- The workshop user's Essbase credentials.
- The PeakGear cube imported with data in Lab 3.

2. In **Ad Hoc Analysis**, select a member and click **Zoom In** in the upper-left toolbar. Repeat along each path:

   - `Time` → `FY2021` → `2021-Q1` → `2021-01`
   - `Product` → `ACTIVEWEAR` → `SKU-100002`
   - `Store` → `Austin` → `Store_004`
   - `Measures` → `Sales`

> **Note:** Alternatively, go directly to the same POV by renaming each dimension to the last value in its path: Time = 2021-01, Product = SKU-100002, Store = Store_004, and Measures = Sales.
